pyvix is a Python wrapper for the VMWare VIX C API that allows Python
to programmatically control VMWare virtual machines.

Example operations include:
 - powering on/off;
 - suspending;
 - creating, reverting to, and removing snapshots;
 - sending/receiving files to/from the virtual machine;
 - running programs on the virtual machine.


= Build and install =
rm -rdf build/; python setup.py build; python setup.py install

Note that `python setup.py build` will call gcc to build the Python
extension module and link it to libvmware-vix.so. Make sure you use
the same compiler version for both libvmware-vix.so and the extension.
I "solved" some Segmentation Faults by matching the compiler versions.

= Run tests =
a) /usr/bin/py.test
   - this will run all tests in tests/
   - add "-v" to see the actual tests
   - add "-s" to see printf() from the C extensions and print from Python

b) gdb --args /usr/bin/python /usr/bin/py.test tests/test_vm.py -s -v
   - run it like this under gdb: it needs as first argument a binary
    executable, not a script.
