= Build and install =
rm -rdf build/; python setup.py build; python setup.py install

= Run tests =
a) /usr/bin/py.test
   - this will run all tests in tests/
   - add "-v" to see the actual tests
   - add "-s" to see printf() from the C extensions and print from Python

b) gdb --args /usr/bin/python /usr/bin/py.test tests/test_vm.py -s -v
   - run it like this under gdb: it needs as first argument a binary
    executable, not a script.
